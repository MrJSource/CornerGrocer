# CornerGrocer
Corner Grocer program for cs210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was for cs210 class and used to count items from an input file, create a .dat file with item frequency and offer menu options
 to choose from for using this data such as checking frequency of a specific item or printing all items and frequency to the console.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel as thou i did particularly well separating each function so that code can be reused for other programs if needed.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would enhance my code by adding a better menu format and just formatting overall and error checking on opening files right now it has none i forgot to add it

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found error checking the hardest im not used to c++ and coming from java things are just hard for me to get used to.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
overall all skills such as writing clean usable code and understanding new languages and handling errors.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable by separating each function so that code can be written to adjust each item independently. I made it readable by
 including inline comments so others can see what i was aiming for with item. I made it adaptable by including a default constructor and one that can be used to set
 input/output files of different names so this whole class could be adjusted for any program you need to read from a file the amount of times each item is listed. one could
 do this with minimal effort.
